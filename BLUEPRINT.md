# Reinforced Molecular Dynamics (rMD) Implementation

## Introduction

This project aims to implement and provide a computational framework for Reinforced Molecular Dynamics (rMD) as described in the paper "[Reinforced molecular dynamics: Physics-infused generative machine learning model explores CRBN activation process](doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.12.638002)" by Istv치n Kolossv치ry and Rory Coffey. The rMD technique combines Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation data with a physics-informed autoencoder to efficiently explore protein conformational space and model dynamic processes.

## Methodology

The core of this implementation follows the rMD methodology:

1.  **MD Simulation & Free Energy (FE) Map Generation:** (Details on how to acquire or generate FE maps and MD trajectories, including Collective Variable (CV) definitions)
    *   Collective Variable (CV) definitions (e.g., based on atom/residue COM distances).
    *   Free Energy (FE) map computation using methods like meta-eABF.
2.  **Informed Autoencoder Training:**
    *   **Architecture:** Encoder-decoder network with a latent space.
    *   **Loss Functions:**
        *   `Loss2` (Reconstruction Loss): Minimizes RMSD between input and reconstructed structures.
        *   `Loss1` (Latent-to-CV Loss): Minimizes distance between latent space coordinates and CV coordinates.
    *   **Training Process:** Simultaneous optimization of `Loss1` and `Loss2` to map the latent space to the physical FE landscape.
3.  **Structure Generation & Exploration:**
    *   Generating protein structures from latent space or CV coordinates.
    *   Exploring conformational transitions by defining paths on the FE map and reconstructing corresponding structures.
4.  **Post-processing:**
    *   Relaxation of generated structures using tools like Rosetta Relax.
