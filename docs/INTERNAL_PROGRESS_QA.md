# QA Engineer: Sprint 0 Infrastructure Tasks

### Task 0.1: Framework Setup (`pytest`, `flake8`)
**Status:** ⏸ **PAUSED**
**Reason:** Dependent on Developer completing Task 0.1.4 and 0.1.5 (creating `setup.cfg`). Verification pending.

### Task 0.2: Prepare Test Plan Drafting
**Status:** ✅ **DONE**
**File Content Summary:** Created initial, non-functional test stubs in `tests/` for User Stories 0.2 (Data Prep), 1.1 (CVs), and 1.2 (MD Setup).

### Task 0.3: Jupyter Test Environment (`tests/functional_test_harness.ipynb`)
**Status:** ✅ **DONE**
**File Content Summary:** Created the Jupyter Notebook. It includes necessary imports and a Markdown header for "Sprint 1: Data Preparation Tests," ready for step-by-step functional testing.

---
**Next Step for QA Engineer:** Review the Developer's completion of Sprint 0 and begin Sprint 1 tasks (further test creation and initial test execution).
