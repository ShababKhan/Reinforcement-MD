# Reinforced Molecular Dynamics (rMD) Project Blueprint

## Introduction

This document outlines the project plan for recreating the "Reinforced Molecular Dynamics" (rMD) system described in the paper by KolossvÃ¡ry and Coffey. The rMD technology is a physics-infused generative machine learning model that combines molecular dynamics trajectory data and free-energy map data to train a dual-loss function autoencoder network. This allows for more efficient exploration of protein conformational space than traditional molecular dynamics simulations.

The primary case study in the paper examines the CRBN protein's open-to-closed conformational transition, which is important in targeted protein degradation mechanisms.

## Methodology Summary

The reinforced molecular dynamics (rMD) methodology combines traditional molecular dynamics simulations with machine learning to explore protein conformational space more efficiently. The key components of the methodology are:

1. **Molecular Dynamics Simulation**: 
   - Run meta-eABF (extended Lagrangian adaptive biasing force) simulations to generate trajectory data
   - Define meaningful collective variables (CVs) that capture the biological function of interest
   - Compute a free-energy map over the CV space

2. **Autoencoder Network**:
   - Design an encoder that compresses protein structures into a low-dimensional latent space
   - Design a decoder that reconstructs structures from the latent space
   - Link the latent space to the CV space using a physical context

3. **Dual-Loss Training**:
   - Loss1: Measures how well the latent space coordinates match the CV coordinates
   - Loss2: Measures reconstruction accuracy (RMSD between input and output structures)
   - Combine losses to simultaneously optimize both objectives

4. **Structure Generation**:
   - Use the trained network to generate new structures from arbitrary points in the CV space
   - Define transition paths in the CV space (e.g., using B-splines)
   - Sample points along paths to generate conformational transitions
   - Post-process generated structures to improve quality

5. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Compare the latent space distribution to the free-energy map
   - Analyze transition pathways between different conformational states
   - Validate generated structures against experimental data
