### Initial Project Blueprint Generation

This document serves as the foundational plan for recreating the scientific software described in the source paper using an Agile development framework.

#### 1. Agile Project Plan

The project will be executed over three sprints, focusing on building, integrating, and verifying the core scientific software.

##### SPRINT 1: Foundational Modules & Data Pipeline (Initial Build)

| User Story / Task | Description | Duration (Days) | Acceptance Criteria | Assignee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US-1.1** Data Utility Module | **(Developer)** Implement functions for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing raw MD or materials data (e.g., PDB, XYZ, or custom formats). | 2 | All I/O functions (load/save) implemented and unit-tested to handle edge cases (missing data, incorrect format). **`data_utils.py` complete.** | Dev |
| **US-1.2** State Representation | **(Developer)** Develop the function to convert raw data into the necessary "state" vector/tensor for the RL agent (e.g., featurization of atomic coordinates, energies). | 1 | A function exists that takes raw data and returns a structured tensor suitable for the model input. | Dev |
| **US-1.3** Initial Model Structure | **(Developer)** Define the deep learning model architecture (e.g., sequential/graph layers, input/output dimensions) without final training logic. | 2 | **`rmd_model.py` structure defined.** Model can instantiate without errors and accept mock input from US-1.2. | Dev |
| **US-1.4** Unit Test Development (S1) | **(QA Engineer)** Write unit tests for all functions in `data_utils.py` and structural tests for `rmd_model.py`. | 2 | All functions in `data_utils.py` are covered by tests ensuring correctness and stability. | QA |

##### SPRINT 2: Core Logic, Loss, and Integration

| User Story / Task | Description | Duration (Days) | Acceptance Criteria | Assignee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US-2.1** Custom Loss/Reward Function | **(Developer)** Implement the key scientific loss function, translating the paper's objective into a differentiable metric (e.g., negative potential energy, free energy difference, or custom reward function). | 2 | **`loss_functions.py` implemented.** The function accepts model predictions and ground-truth values/environmental feedback, returning a correct scalar loss/reward value. | Dev |
| **US-2.2** Training Loop Implementation | **(Developer)** Integrate the model, data pipeline, and loss function into a standard training loop (either supervised, Q-learning, or policy gradient). | 3 | **`rmd_model.py` finalized with training and prediction methods.** The model can be trained on mock data for at least 1 epoch and show decreasing loss/increasing reward. | Dev |
| **US-2.3** Analysis Module (Basic) | **(Developer)** Implement initial utility functions for result visualization (e.g., plot loss curves, compute RMSD/energy statistics). | 1 | **Initial functions in `analysis.py` implemented.** Can generate simple plots from training logs and simulation outputs. | Dev |
| **US-2.4** Integration Tests (S2) | **(QA Engineer)** Design and implement an end-to-end integration test ensuring the data loader, model forward pass, and loss calculation work together seamlessly. | 2 | A single test case exists that successfully runs a batch of data through the entire pipeline (data -> model -> loss) without assertion failures. | QA |

##### SPRINT 3: Validation, Documentation, and Polish

| User Story / Task | Description | Duration (Days) | Acceptance Criteria | Assignee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **US-3.1** Scientific Validation | **(Developer)** Run the final integrated code on two distinct, representative scientific datasets to reproduce results/metrics claimed in the paper (e.g., compare efficiency gain vs. traditional MD). | 3 | Output metrics (speedup, target property value) match the claims or figures/tables presented in the reference paper within an acceptable scientific tolerance. | Dev |
| **US-3.2** Advanced Analysis | **(Developer)** Finalize the `analysis.py` module to generate all final figures and statistics required for the documentation. | 1 | All figures/tables referenced in the paper can be generated by this module. | Dev |
| **US-3.3** Documentation Finalization | **(Developer)** Fill out all sections of the `README.md` and `PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md` as per the defined framework. | 2 | All sections (**Introduction, Methodology, Dependencies, Tests**) are complete, clear, and accurately reflect the implemented code. | Dev |
| **US-3.4** Code Review & Acceptance Testing | **(QA Engineer)** Perform a full code quality review (PEP 8 compliance check) and acceptance testing against the paper's claims. | 2 | All code passes PEP 8 linter. Acceptance tests verify that the software delivers the core purpose described in the scientific paper. | QA |

**Technology Stack:** Python

**Required Libraries & Dependencies:** (Managed via `requirements.txt`)

*   `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `tqdm`

#### 3. Methodology Summary & Documentation Framework

##### High-Level Methodology Summary

"The system employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm to guide Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations towards a specific scientific objective (e.g., reaching a target configuration, accelerating a rare event, or optimizing a material property). It introduces a custom reward function (`loss_functions.py`) that incorporates domain-specific knowledge (e.g., potential energy, structural features). A Deep Neural Network model (`rmd_model.py`) acts as the agent, processing raw structural data (`data_utils.py`) to determine optimal 'actions' or external forces to apply during the MD simulation. The resulting trajectories and performance metrics are then analyzed (`analysis.py`) to validate the scientific improvements over traditional MD methods."
