# Project Blueprint: Scientific Software Replication

This document serves as the master record, linking the research paper's requirements to the code implementation, unit tests, and methodology validation, as per Project Mandate.

## 1. Project Overview

*   **Source Material:** [PENDING SCIENTIFIC PAPER LINK/CONTENT]
*   **Objective:** [To be derived from the paper's abstract/methods once available.]

## 2. Agile Implementation Log

| Task ID | Paper Section Implemented | Status | Developer | QA Verified |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| T-001 | [To be defined in Blueprint] | PENDING | [Developer] | No |

## 3. Methodology Mapping

This section details exactly how scientific concepts translate into code logic.

### A. Core Algorithms

| Function/Module | Implemented In | Paper Reference | Methodology Narrative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Function Name] | `src/[file.py]` | [Section X.Y] | [Brief explanation of implementation logic.] |

### B. Validation and Metrics

| Metric/Test | Verified In | Paper Reference | Validation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Metric Name] | `tests/[test_file.py]` | [Section Z] | [How the test ensures scientific correctness (e.g., matching boundary conditions).] |

## 4. Developer Notes & Self-Correction Log (PEP 8 Compliance)

*   [T-001 Post-Implementation Self-Check: Linting Passed: Yes/No. All tests passed: Yes/No.]
