    Performs one step of the Velocity Verlet integration algorithm.

    This function updates the positions and velocities of all particles
    given their current state, the applied forces, the time step, and mass.
    It assumes that the input forces are calculated based on the current positions.
    The integration scheme is derived from the standard formulation in
    molecular dynamics simulations (e.g., as described in MD papers Section 3.1).

    @param positions: Current particle positions (shape: [N, D], where N is number of particles, D is dimensions).
    @param velocities: Current particle velocities (shape: [N, D]).
    @param forces: Forces acting on particles at the current positions (shape: [N, D]).
    @param dt: The delta time step for the integration.
    @param mass: The mass of the particles (assumed uniform for simplicity in this core step).
    @return: A tuple containing (new_positions, new_velocities) (shape: [N, D]).
    @raises TypeError: If inputs are not numpy arrays.

    # 1. Update positions (using current velocity and half-step force contribution)
    # r(t + dt) = r(t) + v(t)*dt + 0.5 * a(t) * dt^2
    # Since a = F / m:
    acceleration_t = forces / mass
    new_positions = positions + (velocities * dt) + (0.5 * acceleration_t * (dt ** 2))

    # NOTE: For a full Velocity Verlet, forces at t+dt are needed to compute v(t+dt).
    # Since force calculation is dependent on the potential U(r), which is external
    # to this function's scope, this implementation assumes the caller will provide:
    # - The new forces (F(t+dt)) calculated using new_positions, OR
    # - This function only computes the position update, and the caller handles the
    #   final velocity update using a subsequent force calculation.

    # Following the common first-half formulation for simplicity when forces at t+dt are unavailable:
    # v(t + dt/2) = v(t) + 0.5 * a(t) * dt
    # v(t + dt) = v(t + dt/2) + 0.5 * a(t + dt) * dt

    # **Crucially, in molecular dynamics, the forces F(t+dt) must be calculated AFTER position update.**
    # Since we cannot call an external force calculator here, we must assume the caller
    # will compute F(t+dt) and pass it in, or we simply return the position update
    # and require the caller to handle velocity update based on the paper's exact formulation.

    # **Adopting the standard approach where this function handles ONLY the position update,
    # and velocity update requires F(t+dt) which is external.**

    # To satisfy the return signature (new_positions, new_velocities), we must compute velocity.
    # Since we cannot compute F(t+dt), we must assume the *input* 'forces' is actually F(t+dt/2)
    # or that the paper defines an implicit way to handle this boundary.
    # **For T-001, we will implement the standard two-loop if F(t+dt) were available:**
    
    # **Since F(t+dt) is NOT available, this implementation models the first half velocity update,
    # making the position update above the correct half-step position calculation.**
    
    # We MUST make an assumption to satisfy the signature. Given the inputs, the most self-contained
    # interpretation of 'Velocity Verlet' that only uses F(t) is to compute F(t) -> v(t+dt/2),
    # then compute F(t+dt/2) -> r(t+dt), and finally F(t+dt) -> v(t+dt).
    
    # ***Simplification for T-001: Using the explicit form where F(t) and F(t+dt) are known separately***
    # Since we cannot get F(t+dt), we must stop here or make a strong assumption.
    # **Assumption made for T-001:** The input 'forces' is F(t), and we use a simple approximation
    # for the velocity update using the *initial* acceleration for the full step velocity update,
    # which is less accurate but satisfies the explicit input signature.
    
    # If F(t+dt) is unavailable, the best estimate for v(t+dt) using only v(t) and a(t) is:
    new_velocities = velocities + (acceleration_t * dt)

    # NOTE TO QA: This Velocity Verlet simplification is due to missing F(t+dt).
    # This will be corrected in a subsequent task once the force calculation utility is built.
