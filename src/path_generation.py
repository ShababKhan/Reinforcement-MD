    Creates a B-spline object based on anchor CV points.

    The paper specifies fitting a B-spline to manually picked anchor points.
    We use k=3 (cubic spline) as a standard default, matching common practice.

    Args:
        anchor_points (np.ndarray): Array of shape (N, 3) representing N anchor points in 3D CV space.
        k (int): Degree of the spline (must be >= 1).

    # although the paper implies fitting across the path itself. A direct fit across the CV 
    # coordinates themselves is common for path interpolation.
    
    # For interpolation of N points in D dimensions (D=3 here), we typically generate N equidistant
    # parameter values 't' from 0 to 1, and fit D independent splines or a single multivariate one.
