    Calculates the effective diffusion coefficient (D_eff) by integrating
    the concentration profile according to the Fickian diffusion model
    for a discrete measurement set.

    The calculation implements the integral form: D_eff = (1 / (2 * C0)) * integral(D(C)),
    where the integral is approximated using the Trapezoidal Rule on the
    provided (C, D) pairs. This function assumes the input gradient_data 
    provides pairs of (Concentration C, Local Diffusion D(C)).

                          diffusion coefficient at that concentration. Should be sorted by C.
