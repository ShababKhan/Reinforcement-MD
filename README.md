# Reinforced Molecular Dynamics (rMD) Reproduction Project

This repository aims to faithfully reproduce the **Reinforced Molecular Dynamics (rMD)** methodology proposed by Kolossv√°ry & Coffey (2025) to model the CRBN open-close conformational transition.

## Project Status
**Blueprint Complete.** Currently in **Sprint 1: Data Ingestion and Base Model Foundation**.

## Documentation
For the full breakdown of the scientific methodology, user stories, and acceptance criteria, refer to:
- **`docs/rMD_METHODOLOGY.md`**

## Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Deep Learning:** PyTorch (Recommended)
- **Tools:** NumPy, SciPy (for B-spline/Math)

## Contact
AI Project Manager overseeing the execution.
