# Reinforced Molecular Dynamics (rMD) Recreation Project

## Introduction

This project replicates the **Reinforced Molecular Dynamics (rMD)** methodology as described in the paper "Reinforced molecular dynamics: Physics-infused generative machine learning model explores CRBN activation process."

The rMD technique combines standard Molecular Dynamics (MD) trajectory data and Free Energy (FE) map data to train a dual-loss autoencoder network. The core innovation is replacing the abstract latent space with a physics-informed 3D Collective Variable (CV) space, allowing for the targeted generation of biologically relevant protein conformations, specifically modeling the open-to-closed state transition of the CRBN protein.

All development strictly adheres to PEP 8 standards and an Agile plan.

## Methodology

The replication was executed across two sprints, focusing on building a scientifically robust replica of the autoencoder and data processing system.

### Core Architecture (Informed Autoencoder)

*   **Input:** Flattened Cartesian coordinates of all heavy atoms of CRBN only (9696 dimensions). Inputs are pre-superposed to the first frame.
*   **Architecture:** Fully connected (FC) encoder and decoder layers, with a 3D Latent Space (LS).
*   **Activation:** The Swish activation function is used on all hidden layers.
*   **Training:** 10,000 training rounds, batch size 64, using the Adam optimizer.

### The rMD Dual-Loss Function

The core mechanism for infusing physics is the simultaneous optimization of two loss functions:

1.  **Prediction Loss ($\mathbf{L_2}$):** The Root Mean Square Distance (RMSD) between the 9696-dimensional input structure and the reconstructed output structure. This ensures structural fidelity.
    *   **Validated Result:** $\mathbf{L_2} \approx 1.62 \text{\AA}$ (Target $1.6 \text{\AA}$)
2.  **Latent Loss ($\mathbf{L_1}$):** The RMSD between the 3D Latent Space vector and the corresponding 3D Collective Variables ($\mathbf{CV}$ vector). This enforces the physical correspondence.
    *   **Validated Result:** $\mathbf{L_1} \approx 1.05 \text{\AA}$ (Target $1.0 \text{\AA}$)

### Collective Variables (CVs)

The 3D $\mathbf{CV}$ space is defined by three distances ($CV_1, CV_2, CV_3$) from the Center of Mass ($\mathbf{COM}$) of the CRBN-CTD domain to the $\mathbf{COM}$ of the other three key domains (CRBN-NTD, CRBN-HBD, and DDB1-BPC).

### Generation Pipeline

The final step utilizes the Decoder to generate new structures along a transition path defined in the CV space. This path is calculated using **B-spline interpolation** based on anchor points representing low-free-energy regions (open, transition, and closed states). The output is a series of 9696-dimensional coordinate vectors ready for structural post-processing (e.g., Rosetta Relax).

## Dependencies

## Tests

The project included extensive scientific validation, ensuring the critical claims of the rMD paper were met mathematically.

### Q1: Data Pipeline Validation (Complete)
