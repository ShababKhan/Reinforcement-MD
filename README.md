# Project: Cellular Automata Simulator (CAS) Based on [Paper Title Placeholder]

## Introduction
A brief overview of the scientific problem this software addresses and the general approach taken by the paper.

## Methodology
Detailed description of the implemented scientific methodology, directly referencing formulas and algorithms used in the paper. This section should explain the CA model, the neighborhood type, the state space, and the specific transition functions used (if not defined in the config).

## Dependencies
A complete list of all Python libraries and any external tools required to run the software.
*   **Primary Technology:** Python 3.x
*   **Core Libraries:** NumPy (Required)
*   **Installation Instructions:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Tests
Description of the verification strategy, including which specific figures or results from the paper are being targeted by the integration tests.

*   **Unit Test Coverage Target:** 90%+
*   **Integration Test Cases:** [TBD during Sprint 3]
