# Reinforced Molecular Dynamics (rMD) Software Recreation

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python-based recreation of the Reinforced Molecular Dynamics (rMD) software, as described in the scientific paper "Reinforced molecular dynamics: Physics-infused generative machine learning model explores CRBN activation process" by Kolossv√°ry and Coffey (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.12.638002).

The rMD technology aims to explore protein conformational space more efficiently than traditional Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations by integrating MD trajectory data and Free Energy (FE) map data into a dual-loss function autoencoder network. This physics-infused approach enables targeted generation of protein structures and exploration of conformational transitions.

## Methodology
(This section will detail the implementation of the rMD methodology, including the autoencoder architecture, dual-loss function, collective variable definitions, free energy map integration, training process, and structure generation/post-processing steps. It will reference the original paper's figures and descriptions.)

### Core Concepts
*   **Informed Autoencoder:** A neural network architecture comprising an encoder and a decoder.
*   **Dual-Loss Function:**
    *   `Loss2 (Prediction Loss)`: Measures the reconstruction accuracy of protein structures.
    *   `Loss1 (Latent Loss)`: Aligns the autoencoder's latent space with a physical Collective Variable (CV) space.
*   **Collective Variables (CVs):** Low-dimensional variables capturing key biological motions (e.g., distances between protein domain centers of mass for CRBN's open-close transition).
*   **Free Energy (FE) Map:** A pre-computed landscape over the CV space, providing physical context to the latent space.
*   **Structure Generation:** Using the trained autoencoder to predict new protein conformations from sampled points or paths on the FE map.
*   **Post-processing:** Refining generated structures to correct geometric distortions.

### Implementation Details
(Details on how each component, function, and algorithm from the paper is implemented in Python. E.g., specific neural network layer dimensions, activation functions, optimizer, training parameters.)

## Dependencies
(This section will list all required Python libraries and their versions. It will also note any external software or data required, such as pre-computed MD trajectories or free energy maps, even if generated by other tools.)
