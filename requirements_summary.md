- scipy: For advanced mathematical functions, particularly related to signal processing (wavelet transforms).
- pandas: For handling time series data structures (initial data loading and formatting).
- matplotlib: For data visualization (replicating figures from the paper).
- scikit-learn: (Tentative) If any basic machine learning utilities (e.g., standard scaling, simple metrics) are required.
